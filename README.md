# Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem II 

The Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in which more than one salesman is allowed. MTSP involves assigning M salesmen to N cities, and each city must be visited by a salesman while requiring a minimum total cost.

### Solutions: 
* ### Simulated Annealing (SA):
  - Simulated Annealing is an optimization technique inspired by the thermodynamic process of cooling metals. Within a set of solutions, there is an optimal solution that is found by searching the neighborhood. This process happens randomly until the entire neighborhood is explored.
  -  Initially, we start with a high temperature (T), such as 100¬∫C, which allows for a high probability of accepting worse solutions at first, helping to escape local minima.

    - As the algorithm progresses, the temperature gradually decreases according to a cooling rate (Œ±). As the temperature decreases, the probability of accepting worse solutions also reduces (if Œî > 0 or

e 
Œî/T
 ), and the algorithm becomes more focused on refining the already found solutions.
  - The goal is that, by the end of the process, when the temperature is low, the algorithm has found a solution close to the optimal.
    
* ### Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA):
   - an optimization technique that uses vectors of real numbers between 0 and 1 (random keys - the genes) to represent solutions. These keys are decoded to generate the tour that will be performed by the salesmen.
   - The initial population is generated randomly and evaluated by a fitness function to find the elite solutions.
   - The best solutions are selected for reproduction.
   - Reproduction combines pairs of solutions, creating offspring through crossover.
   - Random mutation is applied to maintain diversity and increase the chances of finding the optimal solution.
   - This cycle of evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation continues until the number of generations is reached, which is the stopping criterion.
